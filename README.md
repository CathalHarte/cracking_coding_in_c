Cracking the Coding Interview Worked Examples in C
===================================================
Toolchain
---------
gcc, gdb, visual studio code

Commit Strategy
---------------
A coding interview would have me writing code on paper. The first commit of each file will be a direct copy of my on-paper attempt, documented so that I can review my language precision at a later time. The subsequent commit will contain the necessary fixes to run the algo.
